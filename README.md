nisticaTK
=========
This is an application created by the 2014 Nistica summer interns.

It simplifies the weekly ordering of Thai food that goes on in the company by letting you order food from your computer.

Simply choose what you want to order, submit your payment information, and your food will be sent to be ordered.
